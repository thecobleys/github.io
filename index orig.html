          Hey! I’m Ben. I am a technologist, engineer, & designer. I am
          currently working on game-changing tech for the recycling industry @<a
            >TrueCircle AI</a
          >. Before that, I studied at Imperial College London, where, I
          developed <a>cooking robots</a> and a
          <a>medical diagnosis device</a> [amongst other things!]. During the
          Design Engineering degree, I interned at Google X, Dyson, and
          Brompton. I got to work on some
          <a>great projects with great people</a>. In my free time, I love being
          outdoors and <a>building things with friends</a>. Interested in
          building new things / making a positive impact on earth?
          <a>Say hello!</a>.

            <a href="https://www.truecircle.ai/">TrueCircle AI</a> is a
            climate-tech startup developing ground-breaking computer vision
            hardware that enables recycling facilities to recover valuable
            material more effectively and sell material more efficiently. We
            retrofit industrial cameras above conveyor belts to capture
            continuous footage of material streams. Our state-of-the-art model
            calculates composition by weight in real-time, to a 95%+ accuracy.
            We’ve built industry-leading dashboards that empower facilites to
            run more efficiently, preventing recyclable material from going to
            landfill.

            TrueCircle partnered with UK facilites to investigate data-driven
            optimisation of recycling processes. A typical TrueCircle AI user is
            a Plant Manager who is preocupied with keeping unreliable equipment
            running, and doesn't have time to experiment with upgrades to
            improve profitability. Our users lacked any data to inform decisions
            on upgrading equipment, or calibrate the price of their recycled
            material. The existing players in the market couldn't offer a
            solution accurate enough to justify their time-consuming and costly
            setup process.

            I joined as TrueCircle's first full-time hardware engineer. Over the
            past year+, launched a product that can be retrofit in a few hours,
            with zero up-front hardware cost for our customers. We send instant
            alerts flagging operational issues, and we can verify material
            purity with 95+% accuracy in 30+ facilities internationally. Buyers
            now trust material quality, leading to a direct increase in revenue
            per tonne. TrueCircle has also launched Trade, an online marketplace
            that allows Plant Managers to buy and sell material verified by
            purity data from our AI vision system, for the first time.

            My responsibilities: Launched TrueCircle’s MVP hardware and led
            installation of our initial pilot system at a UK recycling facility.
            Outlined a roadmap for reducing failure rate. Implemented a strategy
            and led development of new hardware version, resulting in a 10x
            reduction in 12-month failure rate, saving £1000s in maintenance
            costs. Demonstrated technical leadership; designed and implemented
            processes to hand over system installations to a 3rd-party supplier,
            proving product scalability; a key requirement for TrueCircle’s
            upcoming Series A.
